# Permutgen

[FEDD](https://github.com/jsalzbergedu/FEDD2017.git) group level generator for a scratch project.

The goal of this is to shore up the weaknesses of scratch, namely
scratch's inability to organize data, with an external program that
organizes data well. All the scratch game has to do is go from the initial
states to the final states in part of one long list. Permutgen does 
the work of generating these states.

## Level files

The level generator takes level files as input and generates a list
that can be uploaded to scratch as output. The level files are documented
in the file `teststax.level`.
